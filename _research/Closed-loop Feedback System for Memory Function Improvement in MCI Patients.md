Based on research of abnormal brain network mechanism and closed-loop feedback regulation technique in MCI patients during naturalistic viewing.
------

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis and intervention of MCI is the key to delaying or preventing Alzheimer's disease. However, there is a lack of effective medicine treatment for MCI, and the development of non-drug intervention technology has received great attention in recent years. Our project intends to focus on the key issues of non-invasive closed-loop intervention in MCI. <br>
Oriented by the abnormal mechanism of MCI memory-related cognitive function networks, we will make full use of EEG to uncover the abnormal brain network information of MCI patients during naturalistic viewing, new targets for brain networks based on real-time EEG closed-loop feedback will be developed. Combining machine learning and Norms methods for coding and decoding targets, the system is built using computer techniques.<br>

Furthermore, the changes in synchronous connectivity are related to cognitive function which has been suggested by the correlation with neuropsychological assessment scores.

The orange and blue circles indicate the NC and MCI subjects, respectively. The black line and shaded area show the estimated regression curves and 95% confidence intervals derived from regression analysis. r: Pearson correlation coefficient; p: p-value.
